Rubric](<https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/7359899771/rubric>)

1.  fork this project to your github, then do a pull request. You'll
    find `article.html`, the article mockup image and a file called`
    README.md` inside.

2.  Use what you've learned about web development so far to
    edit `article.html` so that it looks **exactly** like the mockup image. You
    will need to use new elements, which means that you'll need
    to [research](<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element>) and
    experiment! (Hint: they are called "superscript," "horizontal rule," and
    "strikethrough.")
